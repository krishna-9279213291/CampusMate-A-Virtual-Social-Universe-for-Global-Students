🛠 Step-by-Step Guide to Start
✅ Step 1: Create File Structure
pgsql
Copy code
campusmate/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── js/
│   └── app.js
├── assets/
│   └── icons, images, logos
└── backend/
    ├── server.js
    └── routes/
        └── auth.js, users.js, colleges.js
✅ Step 2: Start With HTML + CSS Navigation
I’ll now generate:

A complete HTML page with sidebar + all 6 icons

Matching CSS styles
